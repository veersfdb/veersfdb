To improve your knowledge and usage of tenses, there are just a few things you have to keep in mind. Take a look at the following points.

Keep a clear mind. Be ready to unlearn and relearn.
Understand what tenses are and how they are used.
There are particular patterns in which each tense is conjugated. The whole process would become a lot easier if you try to identify the patterns and understand them. For example, the continuous tense takes a helping verb and verb in the present participle form (verb+ ing).
Go through as many examples as you can find. Practice as much as you can, and you will know how exactly each tense works out in different contexts.
There are, of course, a few exceptions. You just have to go through them keenly and apply them. It will surely take time, but you will be able to master it with your determination and continuous effort.
Above all, there is one thing that you should add to your list of to-do things. Read books (anything that is informative and interests you), watch movies, videos or even series. Without even your knowledge, you will be able to develop your vocabulary and learn so many different sentence structures that use various tense forms.

The Simple Present Tense:
The simple present tense is employed in a sentence to represent an action or event that takes place, or just happened in the given context at the present moment. The simple present is also called as the present indefinite tense

Definition of Simple Present Tense
According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the simple present tense form of the verb in a sentence is defined as “the tense that is used to refer to events, actions, and conditions that are happening all the time, or exist now.” The Cambridge Dictionary gives a much more elaborate definition of the simple present tense. According to them, “the present tenses of a verb are the ones that are used to talk about things that happen regularly or situations that exist at this time. The simple present tense uses the base form or the ‘s’ form of a verb, as in ‘I play tennis twice a week’ and ‘She works in a bank’.”

Structure of the Simple Present Tense
The structure of the simple present tense can be understood by analysing the positive, negative, interrogative and negative interrogative forms of the tense. Have a look at the following simple present tense structure chart so that you can understand easily how it works.

Structure of Simple Present Tense
Positive	Negative	Interrogative	Negative Interrogative
Subject + Verb in the base form/third person plural form	Subject + Do not/Don’t/Does not/Doesn’t + Verb in the base form/third person plural form	Do/Does + Subject + Verb	Don’t/Doesn’t + Subject + Verb
Example: You look beautiful.
She looks beautiful.

Example: You do not look beautiful.
She does not look beautiful.

Example: Do you look beautiful?
Does she look beautiful?

Example: Don’t you look beautiful?
Doesn’t she look beautiful?

Rules and Points to Remember When Using the Simple Present Tense
In order to use the simple present tense accurately and effectively, there are some rules and points you have to keep in mind. This is because of the fact that the sentence or the context would not make sense if the verb does not agree with the subject in the sentence.

The first thing that you should understand about the simple present tense is that the verb mostly appears in the base form.
This changes when a third person pronoun or subject is used in a sentence. In this case, the verb used should be made plural.
What Do You Use the Simple Present Tense For?
The present tense can be used for various purposes. The following are the functions of the present tense.

Used to quote general truths and scientific facts.
Used to denote habitual actions that happen on a daily basis or at regular intervals.

Present Continuous Tense:
Understanding the Present Continuous Tense
The present continuous tense, as the name suggests, is the form of tense that is used to denote an action that is ongoing or occurring in that current moment. It is also referred to as the present progressive tense as they represent the action that is progressing in the present. Let us now take a look at the definitions provided by various dictionaries about the present continuous tense.

Definition of the Present Continuous Tense
The Cambridge Dictionary defines the ‘present continuous tense’ as “the verb form used for actions or events that are happening or developing now.” According to the Collins Dictionary, the present continuous tense is defined as “a verb form consisting of an auxiliary be in the present tense followed by a present participle and used especially to indicate that a present action or event is in progress, being repeated, or of a temporary nature or to express the future.” The present continuous tense is “the tense used to talk about actions or behaviour that are in progress now or planned for the future”, according to the Macmillan Dictionary.

Structure of the Present Continuous Tense
There is definitely just one formula to mastering the present continuous tense and this is how it goes.

Subject + am/is/are + present participle (verb+ing) + the rest of the sentence
However, there is something more you should pay attention to. You should also learn how the sentences with the present continuous tense form of the verb are structured when they are positive, negative, interrogative and negative interrogative.

Have a look at the table given below to have a deeper understanding of the structure of the present continuous tense.

Structure of the Present Continuous Tense
Positive	Negative	Interrogative	Negative Interrogative
Subject + am/is/are + present participle (verb+ing) + the rest of the sentence	Subject + am/is/are + not + present participle (verb+ing) + the rest of the sentence	Am/is/are + subject + present participle (verb+ing) + the rest of the sentence	Isn’t/aren’t + subject + present participle (verb+ing) + the rest of the sentence
(Or)

Am/is/are + subject + not + present participle (verb+ing) + the rest of the sentence

Examples:
I am reading a newspaper.
You are doing it wrong.
He is playing tennis.
Examples:
I am not reading a newspaper.
You are not doing it wrong.
He is not playing tennis.
Examples:
Am I reading a newspaper?
Are you doing it wrong?
Is he playing tennis?
Examples:
Am I not reading a newspaper?
Are you not doing it wrong? / Aren’t you doing it wrong?
Is he not playing tennis? / Isn’t he playing tennis?
Rules and Points to Remember When Using the Present Continuous Tense
When using the present continuous tense, make sure you follow the sentence structure exactly.

Always start with the subject when it is a positive or negative sentence and with the helping verb when it is in the interrogative format.
A sentence with the present continuous tense consists of a helping verb (‘to be’ form of verbs) and a main verb. The helping verbs can be ‘am’ for the pronoun ‘I’, ‘is’ for singular subject and ‘are’ for a plural subject.
Just note that like the other pronouns, the pronoun ‘am’ cannot be used in the negative form in an interrogative sentence. Instead of ‘amn’t’, ‘aren’t’ is used.
For example:

Amn’t I reading a newspaper? Wrong
Aren’t I reading a newspaper? Correct
The present continuous tense can never be used with stative verbs.
Uses of the Present Continuous Tense
Like the simple present tense, the present continuous tense is also generally used to talk about an action that is taking place in the present. The only difference is that it denotes an action that is continuing to happen or progressing at the current moment.

Take a look at the following points that elaborate on the more specific uses of the present continuous tense.

It is used to represent an action that is happening or progressing in the moment that the speaker is speaking.
For example:

My son is working on his science project.
Santana is singing Don’t Rain on my Parade.
It is used to depict a future event or arrangement.
For example:

What are you planning to do tomorrow?
I heard that Rachel is moving to Paris next month.
It is used to denote an action that is going on or continuing at the time of speaking.
For example:

Is she still working at the National Institute of Medical Sciences?

Present Perfect Tense:

What Is the Present Perfect Tense?
The present perfect tense is employed in a sentence to represent an action that just happened in the recent past and still has its effect in the present or an action that represents an indefinite time in the past. To have a clearer idea of the tense, let us look at how different dictionaries define the tense.

Definition of the Present Perfect Tense
The Oxford Learner’s Dictionary defines the present perfect tense as “the form of a verb that expresses an action done in a time period up to the present, formed in English with the present tense of ‘have’ and the ‘past participle’ of the verb, as in I have eaten.” According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the present perfect tense is defined as “the form of the verb used for actions or events that have been completed or have happened in a period of time up to now.”

A much more elaborate definition is given by the Collins Dictionary and according to it, “the present perfect tenses of a verb are the ones used to talk about things which happened before the time you are speaking or writing but are relevant to the present situation, or things that began in the past and are still happening.” The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines the present perfect tense as one “relating to, or constituting a verb tense that is traditionally formed in English with have and a past participle and that expresses an action or state begun in the past and completed at the time of speaking (as in “I have finished”) or continuing in the present (as in “We have lived here for several years”).

Structure and Formula of the Present Perfect Tense
The general formula of the present perfect tense is as described below:

Subject + have/has + past participle + the rest of the sentence
The structure of the present perfect tense can be analysed with reference to positive, negative, interrogative and negative interrogative types of sentences. Have a look at the table given below for a closer look at the same.

Structure of the Present Perfect Tense
Positive	Negative	Interrogative	Negative Interrogative
Subject + have/has + past participle + the rest of the sentence	Subject + have/has + not + past participle + the rest of the sentence	Have/has + subject + past participle + the rest of the sentence	Have/has + subject + not + past participle + the rest of the sentence
(or)

Haven’t / hasn’t + subject + past participle + the rest of the sentence

Examples:
I have finished my work.
You have finished your work.
He has finished his work.
She has finished her work.
They have finished their work.
Examples:
I have not finished my work.
You have not finished your work.
He has not finished his work.
She has not finished her work.
They have not finished their work.
Examples:
Have I finished my work?
Have you finished your work?
Has he finished his work?
Has she finished her work?
Have they finished their work?
Examples:
Haven’t I finished my work?
Haven’t you finished your work?
Hasn’t he finished his work?
Hasn’t she finished her work?
Haven’t they finished their work?
Have you not finished your work?
Has she not finished her work?
Has he not finished his work?
Have they not finished their work?
Rules to be Followed When Using the Present Perfect Tense
The very first thing that you will have to learn before you start using present perfect tense is how past participles are formed. In the English language, a past participle is formed by adding an ‘ed’ to the base form of the verb in most cases. However, there are a number of irregular verbs that have different spellings and do not, in any way, follow the concept of adding ‘ed’ to the base form like regular verbs. You can take a look at the extensive list of irregular verbs to analyse how these verbs are in their past participle form.

The next point to remember is that a sentence with the past perfect form of the verb uses two verbs – a helping verb and a main verb. ‘Have’ and ‘has’ are the two helping verbs that are used. ‘Have’ is used when the pronouns ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘they’ or plural nouns act as the subject in a sentence. ‘Has’ is used when the pronouns ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’ or singular nouns act as the subject.

Uses of the Present Perfect Tense
The present perfect tense can be used

To denote an action or event that happened or started in the past and still has its impact or some connection to the subject in the present.
To indicate an action that happened in the past and continues to occur in the present.
To connect the events of the present to the events that happened in the past.

Points to be Remembered When Using the Present Perfect Continuous Tense
Similar to the present perfect tense, the present perfect continuous tense also consists of helping verbs and main verbs. The only difference is that instead of one helping verb and one main verb in the past participle form, the present perfect continuous tense uses two helping verbs and a main verb in the present participle form. The helping verbs used are ‘have’ or ‘has’ along with ‘been’. These verbs are followed by the present participle of the main verb, which is formed by adding an ‘ing’ to the base verb.

The other fact that you should remember is that, like the present perfect tense, the helping verbs ‘have’ and ‘has’ are used in accordance with the pronoun or noun used in the sentence.

The Present Perfect Continuous Tense – Uses
The present perfect continuous tense can be used for the following reasons:

It can be used to represent the progress of an unfinished action that started in the past until now.
