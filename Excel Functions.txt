15 Excel Functions:
1. Concatenate

Use:
Combine text, numbers, dates, and other data from numerous cells.

SYNTAX = CONCATENATE (text1, text2, [text3], …)

2. Len

Use:
to show the number of characters in each cell.

SYNTAX = LEN (text)

3. Days

Use:
The number of calendar days between two dates is calculated using this function

SYNTAX =DAYS (end_date, start_date)

4. Networkdays

Use:
The number of weekends is automatically excluded when using the function. 
Also used in finance and accounting for determining employee benefits based on days worked.

SYNTAX = NETWORKDAYS (start_date, end_date, [holidays])

5. Sumifs

Use:
to add all of its arguments that meet multiple criteria

SYNTAX = SUMIFS (sum_range, range1, criteria1, [range2], [criteria2], …)

6. Averageifs

Use:
Used to take an average based on one or more parameters.

SYNTAX = AVERAGEIFS (avg_rng, range1, criteria1, [range2], [criteria2], …)
7. Countsifs

Use:
To  counts the number of values that satisfy a set of conditions. As a result, it doesn’t need a sum range like SUMIFS.

SYNTAX = COUNTIFS (range, criteria)

8. Counta()

Use:
Used to determines whether a cell is empty or not
COUNTA will allow you to examine any gaps in the dataset.

SYNTAX = COUNTA (value1, [value2], …)

9.Vlookup

VLOOKUP stands for ‘Vertical Lookup.’

Use: 
To tells Excel to look for a specific value in a column (the
so-called ‘table array’) to return a value from another column in the same row.

SYNTAX = VLOOKUP (lookup_value, table_array, column_index_num, [range_lookup])

10. Hlookup
HLOOKUP stands for 'Horizontal Lookup'

Use:
To looks for a value in an array of values, then returns a value from a row you specify in the table or array in the same column.

SYNTAX = HLOOKUP (lookup_value, table_array, row_index, [range_lookup])

11. If

Use:
This function is used to automate decision-making in our spreadsheets.
IF function will ask you to run a logical test, as well as what action to take if the test is true or false.

SYNTAX = IF (logical_test, [value_if_true], [value_if_false])

12. Iferror

Use:
Used to display a more informative error than Excel does, or even execute an alternative computation.

SYNTAX = IFERROR (value, value_if_error)

13. Find/Search

FIND returns the position of one text string within another

SEARCH  will return results for Bigger or bigger, broadening the scope of the query. 

SYNTAX = FIND (find_text, within_text, [start_num])

SYNTAX = SEARCH (find_text, within_text, [start_num])

4. Left/Right

=RIGHT returns the “x” number of characters from the cell’s end
=LEFT returns the “x” number of characters from the cell’s beginning

SYNTAX = LEFT (text, [num_chars])

SYNTAX = RIGHT (text, [num_chars])

15. Rank

=RANK is a quick way to show how values in a dataset rank in ascending or descending order.

SYNTAX = RANK (number, ref, [order])
