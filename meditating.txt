I have been meditating for the last 1 year üßòüèª

Here's a techie way to understand how the mind works
Think of your brain as a recommendation system.

Yes, same recommendation system that Netflix/YouTube uses to show you a perfect video that you will like.

But here instead of a video, you'll be recommended Thoughts!
Now just like YouTubers trap you with clickbaity thumbnails/titles these thoughts also come up with ways to trap you.

It can be your past memories, regrets, mistakes, desire, etc...

You click on YT videos to fulfill your inner desires the same way you engage with these thoughts
Here's the thing, if you click on the video and watch it completely, you'll be recommended similar videos again and again!

What if you engage with negative thoughts? Guess right, you'll be recommended the same thoughts.

üîÅ The more you engage, the deeper you go
Just like you have the power to not click on any video, you can accept/reject thoughts that add value to your life.

You'll be recommended 1000s of thoughts, it's on you if you want to engage with them or not.

Here's where Meditation can help you with that :)
Meditation is nothing but sitting in a comfortable position and watching your thoughts come and go.

You don't have to do anything, don't click on any thoughts (video), just look at them from a third-person view.

If you do engage with it, that's fine, bring it back and try again
