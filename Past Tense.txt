As human beings, we love to speak about what goes on in our lives. In order to be able to express what has happened, you should know how to use the past tense.
What Is Past Tense?
The ‘past tense’ form of a verb, as the term suggests, can be used to speak about or represent an event or action that already happened in the past. One important point you have to keep in mind is that a number of verbs, when used in the past tense, do not follow the general rule of adding ‘ed’ to the end of the verb to form the past tense. Take a look at the different definitions of past tense and the list of past tense verbs to develop a clear idea of the same.

Definition of Past Tense
The Oxford Learner’s Dictionary defines the term ‘past tense’ as “the form of a verb used to describe actions in the past.” According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the past tense form of the verb is “used to describe verb forms in many languages used for actions that have now finished.”

“A verb tense expressing action or state in or as if in the past”, is the definition of past tense, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. The Macmillan Dictionary defines ‘past tense’ as “the forms of a verb group indicating that an action or event happened regularly, or that a situation existed or was true during a period before now.”

Types of Past Tense
The past tense has four different forms to indicate the varied nature of actions that happened in the past. They are:

Simple Past Tense – used to indicate an action or event that happened in the past.
Past Continuous Tense – used to depict an action or event that was continuing in the past.
Past Perfect Tense – used to represent an event or action that happened in the past before another event or action that happened in the past.
Past Perfect Continuous Tense – used to denote an action or event that was taking place in the past until another action or event happened in the past.
Structure of Past Tense
In order to understand the structure of the past tense, take a look at the following table.

Structure of Past Tense
Simple Past Tense	Past Continuous Tense	Past Perfect Tense	Past Perfect Continuous Tense
Subject + Verb + ed / verb in the past tense + the rest of the sentence	Subject + Helping Verb(was/were) + Main verb+ing + the rest of the sentence	Subject + Helping Verb (had) + Past participle of the main verb + the rest of the sentence along with the time frame	Subject + Had + Been + Verb+ing + the rest of the sentence
For example: Nathan met me at the park.	For example: It was raining.	For example: Tony had eaten his dinner before we reached the venue.	For example: Sharan had been practising the guitar when the teacher called for him.
It would be even better if you also learn how the structure of a sentence using the past tense form of the verb changes when used in the positive, negative, interrogative or negative interrogative formats.

Positive	Negative	Interrogative	Negative Interrogative
Subject + Past tense form of the verb	Subject + Did not / Didn’t + Base form of the verb	Did + Subject + Base form of the verb	Didn’t + Subject + Base form of the verb

Simple Past Tense: Did you learn the simple past tense yet? No? Nothing to worry about.
The Simple Past Tense
The simple past tense, in English, is used to represent an action/event that took place in the past. With many verbs, the simple past tense is formed by adding an ‘ed’ or a ‘d’ to the end of the base verb. However, there are other verbs which behave differently and take different spellings when used in the simple past form.

Definition of Simple Past Tense
The ‘simple past tense’, according to the Cambridge Dictionary, is defined as “the form of a verb used to describe an action that happened before the present time and is no longer happening. It is usually made by adding -ed.” The Collins Dictionary defines the ‘simple past tense’ as “a tense used to refer to the past.” The Macmillan Dictionary defines the simple past tense as “the tense used to talk about habitual actions, behaviour, or situations that happened or existed before now.”

Structure of the Simple Past Tense
Learning the structure of the simple past tense can be made simple if you analyse how the tense is used in the positive, negative, interrogative and negative interrogative formats. Look at the table below to have a better understanding of the same.

Structure of Simple Past Tense
Positive	Negative	Interrogative	Negative Interrogative
Subject + Verb in the past form (base form of the verb + ed/d for regular verbs or past tense form of the irregular verbs)	Subject + Didn’t + Verb in the base form	Did + Subject + Verb in the base form	Didn’t + Subject + Verb in the base form
Example: You spoke really well.

Example: You did not speak really well.

Example: Did you speak really well?
Did I have my breakfast?

Example: Didn’t you speak really well?

Rules and Points to Remember When Using the Simple Past Tense
When conjugating a verb in the simple past tense, there are a few points you have to bear in mind.

Conjugating regular verbs – In order to present the main verb in the sentence, you just have to add ‘-ed’ to the end of the regular verb and ‘-d’ to the end of a regular verb which ends with an ‘e’.
For example: Reach – reached, kick – kicked, walk – walked, confess – confessed, work –

worked

Like – liked, introduce – introduced, force – forced, announce – announced,

` notice – noticed

Verbs that remain the same – Some verbs take the same spelling as the base verb and remain the same in the past tense.
For example: Cut – cut, put – put, hurt – hurt, set – set, hit – hit

Verbs that take different spelling patterns – Irregular verbs are seen to follow different spelling patterns and there is no rule as such to explain why they are so.
For example: Buy – bought, think – thought, draw – drew, drink – drank, see – saw

What Do You Use the Simple Past Tense For?

Using the Past Continuous Tense – Points to Remember
Knowing how to structure the verb in the past continuous tense can make your task easy. A verb, when used in the past continuous tense, always takes a helping verb (was or were) and a main verb. The helping verb is followed by the main verb, which happens to be in the present participle form (gerund form – base verb +ing). The sentence should start with a subject when it is a positive or negative sentence. When the tense is used in an interrogative or negative interrogative sentence, it should start with the helping verb, followed by the subject and the main verb.

The past continuous tense can be put to use when,

You want to convey parallel or simultaneous actions.

For example:

I was watering the plants when my brother came home.
When Joe was playing cricket, he sprained his ankle.

For example:

At five o’clock, I was studying for the Maths exam.
Yesterday, she was waiting for me in the evening.

For example:

He was working on his project all day.

Rules to be Followed when Using the Past Perfect Continuous Tense
Similar to the present perfect continuous tense, the past perfect continuous tense also consists of two helping verbs and a main verb. Among the three verbs that represent the tense, the first helping verb should always be ‘had’ followed by ‘been’, which is in turn followed by the present participle of the main verb. This rule holds true when the sentence is a positive sentence. In case you are employing the tense form in an interrogative sentence, the helping verb ‘had’ comes first followed by the subject which is in turn followed by the the helping verb ‘been’ and the present participle of the main verb.

For a negative sentence, ‘not’ is placed after the first auxiliary verb ‘had’ and for a negative interrogative sentence, you can either use the contraction ‘hadn’t’ or place ‘not’ after the subject.

Uses of the Past Perfect Continuous Tense
The past perfect continuous tense is used to perform two main functions. They are:

To denote an action that has been the cause of another action or event in the past.
