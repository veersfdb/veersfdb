The System wants you to believe these 6 Lies.. 

(Wake Up)
1} News 

The news is there to spread negativity. Not to keep you informed. 

They want you: 

- Distracted 
- Belief there lies 
- Control over you 

Observe with your mind, not your eyes.
2} Failure 

You should avoid failure, and there is only one right answer. 

Wrong. 

You need to make mistakes so that you can: 

- Grow
- Learn
- Strengthen your skills 

Nobody is born perfect. Embrace failure and see it as an opportunity to grow.
3} Work hard 

You should work smart, not hard. 

Don't get me wrong, it will still get hard sometimes, but they want you to trade your time for money your whole life. 

1 Minute of your life is worth more than all money combined. 

Stop valuing it more than your time.
4} Money 

Until 1971, money was tied to gold, which gave money value. 

Nowadays, money is tied to nothing. Money is basically worthless. 

Learn how: 

- To create money with no money 
- To make money work for you 
- Money works

or you will work your entire life for it.
5} Change is impossible 

“Life is the way it is” 

That's a lie. Life is what you make out of it. 

Before you can live the life you really want, you have to become the person. 

Change how you:

- Think 
- Feel 
- Act 

and you can become almost anybody.
6} Consumerism 

Many people think fulfillment lies in materialistic things.

It lies in: 

- Personal growth
- Relationships 
- Self-love 

and in contributing to something greater than ourselves. 

You won't find fulfillment anywhere else.
