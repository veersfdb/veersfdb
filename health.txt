Vitamin B12+ Floate:
	Helps assess brain, blood, and nervous system health. These nutrients are especially important for energy and fertility.
Vitamin D:
	Helps assess bone health, fertility, immune health, and more. Make sure it's the 25-hydroxy form.
Thyroid:
	Tests for metabolic/thyroid function and possible autoimmune disorders. If abnormal then ask your doctor to run full panel with reverse thyroid values. This includes T3, T3 free, T3 reverse. T3, T4 free, Thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, and TSH.
Comprehensive Metabolic Panel:
	Test your blood glucose, electrolytes, and liver and kidney function.
Iron Status:
	Tests for iron deficiencies and body's iron stores. Here it's important to ask for total iron, total iron binding capacity, and ferritin. It's tricky to know whether you are really iron deficient but this is a good starting point! If you are deficient, use food sources before suplementing as I don't recommend iron supplements unless absolutely necessary.
Lipid Panel:
	Tests your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Bonus if you can get the omega 3 and omega 6 values!
HBAIC:
	Tests your blood glucose average over 3 months which is more representative than one glucose level.
Fasting Insulin:
	Assesses any level of insulin resistance that cloud contribute to blood sugar dysregulatio, diabetes, or other metabolic diseases.
