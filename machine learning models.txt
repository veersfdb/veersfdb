5 things you should do before you start building machine learning models üî•
1Ô∏è‚É£  Understand data:
Don't rush to build models without thoroughly understanding the data.
Spending enough time here will dictate critical items such as the features you'll use for the model.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Have enough data:
Make sure you have enough data for building the ML model.
Having very little data can lead to the model overfitting or underfitting and, therefore, not being useful.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Speak to experts:
Talking to domain experts before building the model enables you to fill in the information gap, particularly with problems where you are not a domain expert.
It can also inform you of the best features for training the ML model.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Survey the literature:
Survey the literature to see how people have previously solved the problem.
By doing so, you can save time while not trying to reinvent the wheel.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Consider model deployment:
Consider model deployment, as this will dictate many things in the model development process.
For instance, the model should be small enough if it's going to be deployed on edge devices.
Also, consider the desired model latency and throughput.
