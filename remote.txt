Working Remotely:
More employees work away from the office now than ever before. Today’s technology allows employees to work virtually anywhere. But with greater mobility comes greater risk.
To protect businesses and our clients, there are strict data security laws in place and big fines for serious data breaches.
Loss and Theft:
The company relies on you to keep its information safe. If your device is damaged, lost, or stolen, report it immediately so that risks can be contained.
Identify the risks, take appropriate action, and escalate when necessary.
Data Breaches:
Hardware can be replaced. But when data falls into the wrong hands, our company can become involved in lawsuits. The damage can often be irreparable. 
Make sure you keep your devices close to you at all times.
Contamination:
In the past, the threat of malware applied only to PCs and laptops – now tablets and phones are targeted by malware as well. This is becoming a huge problem, as many staff now use mobile devices for work.
You can protect your devices and our data from malware threats by making sure you do not permit others to use your device, maintaining work devices for professional purposes only, and immediately flagging any suspicious correspondences with the relevant department.
Storing Your Devices and Data:
It is essential that information and equipment are always stored securely. Do not leave devices containing confidential information where they could be stolen or damaged.
Ensure that devices are both encrypted and password-protected.
