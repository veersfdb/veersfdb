Have a look at how different dictionaries define the future continuous tense in order to have a much better idea of what it is.

Definition of the Future Continuous Tense
The future continuous tense, according to the Cambridge Dictionary, is defined as a tense that is used to “refer to temporary actions and events that will be in progress at a particular time in the future.” According to the Collins Dictionary, the future continuous tense is used “to suggest that something is about to happen or will happen at some time that is not clear or precise.”

Structure and Formula of the Future Continuous Tense
To have a more detailed idea of the future continuous tense, take a look at the formula and structure of the tense.

The formula of the future continuous tense is as follows:

Subject + Helping verbs (will + be) + present participle form of the verb + the rest of the sentence
Now, analyse the structure of the future continuous tense to see how the sentence structure changes when used as a positive, negative, interrogative and negative interrogative sentence.

Subject + Helping verb (will + be) + Past participle form of the verb + the rest of the sentence	Subject + Will not be/Won’t be + Past participle form of the verb + the rest of the sentence	Will + Subject + Be + Past participle form of the verb + the rest of the sentence	Will + Subject + not + be + Past participle form of the verb + the rest of the sentence

Rules and Points to Remember When Using the Future Continuous Tense
Like the present continuous tense and the past continuous tense, the future continuous tense consists of two helping verbs – ‘will’ and ‘be’ followed by the past participle form of the main verb. The past participle of the main verb can be formed by adding an ‘ing’ to the end of the verb. The tense can be made negative by adding ‘not’ after ‘will’. When used in the interrogative form, the sentence starts with ‘will’ followed by the subject, ‘be’ and the past participle form of the verb.

Furthermore, always keep in mind that the future continuous tense can be used only with action verbs and never with stative verbs. This is mainly because only action verbs can be done for a particular duration. Also, remember that the action mentioned in the future continuous tense would have started earlier but would not have been completed at that particular point in time.

What Do You Use the Future Continuous Tense For?
The future continuous tense can generally be used to,

Denote an action that takes place at a specific time in the future.
Also used to express an action that will take place over a period of time and does not happen all at once in that time.
