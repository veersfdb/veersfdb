You don't decide your future, you decide your habits and your habits decide your future.

No one succeeds overnight and no one fails overnight

Success is nothing more than the sum of small habits repeated day-in day-out

Decide exactly what they want: Most people in life don't get what they want because they don't know what they really want.
You need to set a GOAL. What is it that you really want? Be very specific, is it a car or a house? Whatever it is. Know It.

Beleive it is possible: Whatever your mind can conceive and believe, you can achieve. Winston Churchill.
You have to first believe it is possible.
