A better way to learn Python:

🌞Code daily
🏗️Build a project; small or big
⚒️Work on WHYs not HOWs of the concept
🥅Set a goal & stick with it
💡Show your work & get feedback
📝Don't just read watch topics; practice them
📈Keep moving one notch up DAILY
🎉End of the day ENJOY!!!

Today we are going to talk about the basics of unit testing in #Python 🧵🐍👇

The Python programming language includes built-in packages for testing:
🐍 doctest
🐍 unittest

To kick things off, you'll learn about the `doctest` module! 🧵🐍👇
What is `doctest`? #Python's `doctest` modules looks for pieces of text in docstrings that look like REPL sessions. 
Next, it executes them and verifies that the output in the docstring matches when the code is actually run

Here is an example of a #Python function with a docstring that could be used by the `doctest` module to test that function:
def double(a):
	"""
	>>>double(4) 
	8
	>>> double(9)
	18
	return a*2
-----------------
You call the `doctest` module with #Python by using the `-m` flag with the Python executable

If you call `doctest` without any flags, it will only show output if there is an error in the test

If you pass `-v` to `doctest`, then you run it in verbose mode
#run the module with doctest
