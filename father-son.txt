10 things a father must say to his son:
1. “Get back up” 

Let your son learn from failure. 

Give him guidance when needed.

“Fall down 7 times, get up 8.”

2. “I love you” 

Love the son you have, not the son you want. 

Fatherly love is unconditional.

3. “It’s okay to be angry, sad, or depressed. It’s NOT okay to stay angry, sad, or depressed.” 

To manage emotions, you must first be able to feel and experience them. 

A father needs to teach how to manage, understand, and regulate emotions.

A father needs to treat his wife with respect.

No complaining, fighting, or disrespect.

It’s important to say sorry, and sometimes say you don’t know.

6. “In order to get what you want, you have to deserve what you want.” 

The world isn’t crazy enough to reward a bunch of undeserving people.

7. “You have what it takes. I believe in you.” 

You need to instil a healthy competitive nature, confidence, and self-reliance. 

A strong father will lay the foundation for self-esteem.

You are a hard worker and you’ll figure it out.

Your actions will have consequences. 

You can be anything, but you can’t be everything.

9. “You can’t give what you don’t have.”

Show your son and lead by example.
