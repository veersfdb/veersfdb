The 32nd Law is “Playing to people's fantasies”.
I want to emphasize this law- Play with fantasies, not with their thoughts.
Fantasies bind a curtain of imagination with our eyes. As a result, we can't see the actual truth.

Robert Greene' says: Positive change takes time. It takes patience, discipline, and sacrifices to become successful in life.
But 90% of people just ignore this.
They chase quick success in the easiest way. 
These people are the easy target of fake gurus because they can easily be manipulated and fooled.

This is why fake gurus are becoming successful by selling their guides on how to become successful in 30 days.

Look, if you can make people's minds dip in fantasies, you'll be able to get benefits from it. That's it.
For example, "Jockey" which is an under-wear selling brand in India, sells not only innerwear but also a dream body fantasy to its customers.
Save this if it seems valuable
